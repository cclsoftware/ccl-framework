.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-Delegate:

Delegate
========

Dynamically creates a content view.

**Description**

Every time the Delegate gets attached, it creates a new child view using the given form name and controller.

.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-EmbeddedFrame:

EmbeddedFrame
=============

An EmbeddedFrame defines a sub tree of frames that can appear in the form of a parent class.

**Description**

The EmbeddedFrame element must appear in two places: placed inside the form of a "parent" window class
and placed in the root frame of a perspective with the same name and a parent class. It defines a separate subtree of frames.

When a window class is about to be opened, the workspace system ensures that the parent class, whose view contains the EmbeddeFrame view gets opened first.

.. code-block:: xml
	:caption: Example

	<!-- inside form of parent window -->
	<Form name="MyParentForm">
		<!-- ... -->
		<EmbeddedFrame name="Embedded"/>
	</Form>
	
	<!-- in root frame of perspective -->
	<EmbeddedFrame name="Embedded" parent.class="MyParentClass">

Form
====

A Form is the top level view building block in a skin, accessible by name.

**Description**

There are two main use cases for forms:
1. A form is the entry point in the skin when the application wants to create a specific view.
2. A form can by instantiated from another form using the <View> tag.
This allows structuring large view hierarchies into smaller forms, and reusing the same form in different places.

As an ImageView, a Form can also have a backgoround image or color.

.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-Horizontal:

Horizontal
==========

Arranges child views horizontally, trying to fill the width of the Horizontal element.

**Description**

The intitial widths of the child views are considered their preferred widths. For a given container width,
the total preferred with of all child views can result in either some remaining or missing width.

The horizontal layout tries to distribute this remaining or missing width equally among the child views, by
either enlarging or shrinking the childs. But this is limited by their attachments and their size limits:
Like in the basic layout of the View class, a view only get's sized horizontally, if it's attached left and right to it's parent (attach="left right").

.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-Knob:

Knob
====

A Knob is a circular element that rotates depending on the parameter value.

**Description**

A typical knob draws a static background image, with a partial circle around the center of the knob (set via option or visualstyle "circle").
The circle color is the "hilitecolor" or set from the optional "colorname" parameter.
The visible angle range represents the parameter value. 
Additionally, a line from the center to the end of the circle can be drawn (option "indicator").

A completely different approach to display a knob can be taken with the "filmstrip" option. 
In this case the full knob area is filled with one frame of the "filmstrip" bitmap, 
with the frame index being chosen based on the parameter value.

ProgressBar
===========

A ProgressBar is used to display the progress of an operation.

**Description**

A ProgressBar is usually used to display the progress of an operation, but can also be used with any parameter.

Two separate images, "background" and "foreground" are used to draw the background and the bar.

Additionally, an optional "indicator" image can emphasize the boundary between the background and the bar.

If the foreground image has more than 2 frames, it is used as a filmstrip that cycles through all frames.

.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-Setter:

Setter
======

Trigger action that sets a property of a target object, or a parameter value.

**Description**

Must be placed inside a <Trigger>. 

Sets the property of the given target "property" or "parameter" to the specified "value".

The property path can be an absolute path, or a path relative to the triggering view.
The value can be a constant literal, but when it starts with "@", it is interpreted as another property 
path, and that source property value gets assigned to the target property.

When a "parameter" path is specified instead of "property", the parameter is set to the (always constant) "value".

TextBox
=======

A TextBox displays the text representation of a parameter.

**Description**

The text is drawn in the "textcolor" of the visual style. 
An optional "backgound" image or "backcolor" of the style is drawn unless the "transparent" option is set.

The optional "labelname" specifies a parameter that gives a label text to be appended to the parameter value (e.g. a unit).

The "texttrimmode" specifies how the text is abbreviated when it doesn't fit in the TextBox.

When there is no "textcolor.bright" style definition, the "colorname" parameter is used as text color.
If "textcolor.bright" is defined the "colorname" parameter is used to keep text readable on varying background colors.
It is used to inform the TextBox about the background color. When the luminance of the TextBox goes below the "textcolor.threshold" value,
it switches the text color to the alternative "textcolor.bright" color.
If this background color is transparent "textcolor.transparent" will be used to draw the text

.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-TriVectorPad:

TriVectorPad
============

A Control to edit three parameters in a triangle.

**Description**

The summed-up value of these parameters is always 1.
 With the "invert" option the sum is 2 in the corners and 1 at the snappoints (the edge-center points). 
 If this control is used in addition with individual level controls, the "keeplevels" option allows 
 different sums and reset the parameters to the original values when the handle is moved back to the initial position. 
 (Alt/Option)+drag up-down can change the overall level in the "keeplevel" case

.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-Trigger:

Trigger
=======

A trigger reacts on an event, signaled by a view.

**Description**

The event can be any messsage signaled by a view (attribute "event"). 

As a special case, a "propertyChanged" message can be handled, that only triggers when the property takes a given value. (attributes "property", "value").
When the "trigger" option of a view is set, it sends "propertyChanged" messages for it's "mousestate", "value" and "visualState" (the latter two only for controls).

When a trigger receives the specified event or property change, it executes all of it's actions, which are placed as child elemnts in the <Trigger>.
Actions are executed in order of their appearance.

Available actions are:

<Setter>: sets a property of a target object, or a parameter value 
<Invoker>: invokes a method of a target object 
<StartAnimation>: starts an animation 
<StopAnimation>: stops an animation 

A Trigger can only appear in the <Triggers> list of a Visual Style.

========

Displays a value as a horizontal or verical bar.

**Description**

A ValueBar is a passive control that displays a value as a partially filled rectangle over a background.

If the ValueBar's visual style has an image, the frame "normal" is used for the background, and frame "normalOn" for the bar. 
Otherwise "forecolor" and "backcolor" from the visual style are used to draw the bar and the background as a filled rectangle.
An optional "colorname" parameter can be used to dynamically colorize the hilitebar.

For biplolar parameters, the bar rectangle starts in the center of the view.

View
====

The basic view class.

**Description**

The View class is the general view class that all other view classes inherit from.
It has a size and some more general properties. Not all of these properties have a meaning in all derived view classes.
When views are nested, the "attach" attribute specifies some basic layout behavior.
Defines can be used for style and inside size, width and height attributes:

.. code-block:: xml
	:caption: Example

	<define w="10" z="MyStyle">

.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-WindowClass:

WindowClass
===========

A WindowClass describes a potential screen content.

**Description**

A WindowClass is identified by it's "name".
The most important attributes are "form.name" and "controller", which are used to create a view.
A Command catgegory and name can be specified, that will open or close the window class.

The window manager of the application maintains a parameter for each window class that reflects the
open/closed state of the window. It can be used to toggle it.

It depends on the application how a window class will appear on the screen.
In the simplest case, it might just open a window for each window class.
A more sophisticated approach is a workspace .
In this case, the "group" attribute specifies in which workspace frames the window class can appear.

	:caption: Example

	<Toggle name="://WindowManager/MyClass"/>

.. _skin-elements-classmodel-class-define:

define
======

Defines one or multiple skin variables.

**Description**

Any attribute="value" pair that appears in the Define statement defines a new variable and its value.
The variables are valid inside the <define> tag and in form instantiations from there.

Apart from simple assignments of constant literals or variable values, some extra directives can be used in the value (see code example).

.. code-block:: xml
	:caption: Example

	<define keyName="productKey" listName="productKeyList">
	<define number="@property:number" left="@eval:$number % 2" permission="aux$number">
	
	<!-- Additional directives:
	@property:propertyPath:
	resolve the value of a property (starting with current controller)
	
	@select:$variable:str1,str2,...,strn:
	select a string from a list, indexed by a given variable
	
	@eval:
	evaluate an arithmetic expresssion, with operators
	+ - * / %, parenthesis, constant literals and variable values ($)
